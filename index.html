        <h3>About.Me</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>I am a creative and enthusiastic computer scientist who is excited to start a career within the field. </p>
            <br>
            <p> At a very early age I was given my own computer due to the fear that my constant tinkering would break 
                our family's computer. Throughout the years my curiosity continued to be illuminated by messing around 
                with anything that had an interface. I was originally studying Environmental Science but the class 
                content often left me unhappy and unexcited. After a particularily rough day I came home and buried 
                myself into an Oblivion mod I was creating and realized that someone might actually pay me for this 
                type of work. Sometimes it takes a few tries before you realize that your passion is actually a job.

        <h3>// Sol</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> The goal of the Sol project was to make an emergant open world sandbox. The game had an array of features: 
                town rebuilding, farming, crafting, harvesting, exploration, and combat. I worked as the primary developer for 
                the inventory system and all interactions involving an item. This included: UI design, harvesting, farming, 
                looting, crafting, equipment, resources, item balancing and town rebuilding. This project gave me experience 
                working in a medium sized team and using the Agile software development process. Programmed within the Unity 
                Engine using C#.

        <h3>// DotA 2 UI Enhance</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> Our goal as a team was to add features to make character selection in moba games a more socially 
                positive experience and redesign the interface. The redesigned interface gives players the ability to 
                communicate strategies at an abstracted level meant to reduce toxic behavior and overcome language barriers. 
                This required extensive user testing through-out the iterative design process. The low and Medium fidelity 
                prototypes are shown below. The medium fidelity prototype was made using the Unity Engine.

        <h3>// Caleb's Pit</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> Caleb's Pit featured a fully functioning A* pathing AI based on a dynamically changing heat map unique to each 
                enemy type while being light-weight enough to support 200+ units simultaneously pathing without a queue system. 
                As each monster is slain it drops a corresponding elemental terrain on the ground causing an evolving field of 
                play which provided a unique experience each play while require dynamic pathing updates to the AI. Caleb's Pit also 
                featuring 5 elemental power-ups, 2 character power-ups, and 3 potions which could dramatically change the play 
                experience.
